# Data-Driven Control Systems Toolbox Outline: control-rs

The `control-rs` project is designed as an open-source, native Rust library for numerical modeling and synthesis, specifically focusing on **Model-Based Design (MBD) and firmware development** for embedded systems.

## I. Core Toolbox Architecture and Capabilities

### A. Foundation in Embedded Systems
*   **Native Rust Library:** Leverages Rust's capabilities for high-level safety and low-level control to provide a flexible and powerful toolbox.
*   **Firmware Focus:** Designed specifically for developing firmware, offering efficient and customized implementations, although requiring user comfort with firmware development.
*   **Target Applications:** Meant for developing robotics, autonomous vehicles, UAVs, and other real-time embedded systems that rely on advanced control algorithms. These systems require increased resilience to dynamic conditions.
*   **Arithmetic Support:** Supports embedded constraints by being `no_std` by default (with a `std` feature flag available for plotting). Intends to support both **fixed-point and floating-point numeric types**.
*   **Backend Flexibility:** Numerical algorithms are standardized via traits, allowing for specialized and efficient implementations tailored to specific hardware backends like Neon/CMSIS, MCU-Xpresso DSP, or DSPLib.

### B. Long-Term Project Structure (Design Toolboxes and Components)
The project aims for comprehensive support through two long-term goals:
1.  **Component Templates:** Provide implementations of components common in robotics, such as **ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers), BMS (Battery Management Systems), and odometry systems**. These templates use existing embedded Rust crates to offer detailed implementation and operational guides.
2.  **Design Toolboxes (Wrapper Crates):** Offer specialized models, types, and routines to design and deploy complex control and estimation systems. Examples include toolboxes for autopilot, self-driving vehicles, or chemical process controls.

## II. Data-Driven Modeling and Control

The toolbox centralizes **Data-Driven Constructors** for online modeling. Data-driven control systems base model identification and/or controller design entirely on *experimental data* collected from the plant.

### A. System Identification and Modeling
*   **Methodology:** System identification (SID) is the process of building mathematical models of dynamic systems based on measured data. The core idea of modern predictive control is defining a system in a set of equations (a forward model) that behaves like the original system.
*   **Real-Time Capability:** The project is inspired by real-time system identification and control, which is an important part of aircraft system identification research.
*   **Data Collection & Experiment Design:** The tool can be used to develop and deploy reproducible experiments and data collection procedures. This requires generating suitable input signals (excitation inputs) to produce informative data, especially when dealing with active feedback control.
*   **Parameter Estimation:** Methods like the **Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm** are essential for real-time applications and adaptive control, as they continuously update parameter estimates as new data arrives.
*   **Model Types:** Supports the creation of dynamic system models, including linear and nonlinear systems. When physical insight is limited, the system identification approach may resort to **black-box models** (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks or fuzzy models).

### B. Advanced Control Algorithms
The toolbox should facilitate the use of modern control methodologies that are robust in the presence of uncertainties.
*   **Adaptive Control:** Integration of adaptive control techniques is a planned feature, allowing the package to handle systems with uncertain or time-varying parameters more effectively. Adaptive schemes, like Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), emerged from stability theory.
*   **Optimal Control:** Optimal control allows the designer to specify the *dynamic model* and the *desired outcomes*, computing an optimized control strategy. The use of modern numerical design methods often involves **automatic parameter optimization by minimizing a cost function**, related to solving the Riccati equation.
*   **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** MPC is a dominant advanced method in industrial automation and self-driving/autonomous vehicles, which uses a process model to predict future behavior and solves a constrained optimization problem to determine the control law implicitly.

## III. Integrated Algorithm and Hardware Verification

The development plan includes rigorous tools for safety and dependability, reflecting MBD's role in safety-critical embedded systems.

### A. Algorithm Verification (Formal Methods)
Formal verification tools use **mathematical logic to exhaustively check and formally prove properties** such as program correctness. This approach differs from software testing, as it is not limited by a test set and can guarantee reproducibility and correctness.

Verification within the numerical programs requires reasoning about properties at multiple interconnected layers:
1.  **Language-Level Properties:** Concerns data structures, function pointers, and design patterns. Rust's memory safety (strongly typed, borrow checker, destructive moves) provides a strong foundation.
2.  **Floating-Point Properties:** Reasoning about the IEEE-754 specification of floating-point arithmetic. Verification efforts aim to bound the difference (round-off error) between the implemented result and the exact mathematical result.
3.  **Domain-Specific Properties:** Abstractions related to the specific application, such as derivatives and matrices.

The toolbox aims to implement **Formal Verification** via **procedural test generation for numerical algorithms**. Tools such as static analyzers (like MIRI for checking `unsafe` code) and linters/formatters (`clippy` and `rustfmt`) are integrated to improve code quality before compilation.

### B. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL)
The system leverages HIL and SIL testing, which are crucial for efficient validation of control systems and accelerators for delivery schedules.

*   **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL):** Involves connecting **actual physical components** (like ECUs or sensors) to a real-time simulation platform to test control systems under conditions matching operational scenarios. HIL is generally suitable for later stages or critical risk assessments and focuses on combined hardware-software checks. The toolbox provides a **Test harness that can run/deploy/test firmware**.
*   **Software-in-the-Loop (SIL):** Conducts experiments **entirely within a digital environment**. SIL is typically used for early-stage algorithm validation, initial calibration, parameter tuning, or pure software verification, allowing for rapid iteration of control code.
*   **Testing Coverage:** Both HIL and SIL support comprehensive testing types, including **single-component checks, subsystem verification, stress and fault injection tests**, regression evaluations, and end-to-end system trials.
*   **Integration:** The system plans to implement HIL routines and leverage the embedded hardware abstraction layer (HAL) traits to ensure applications are portable across different hardware platforms. The integration complexity of large-scale projects often requires blending both HIL and SIL methods.
